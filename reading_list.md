# CTO Reading List

### Essential Reading
1. [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) - The Classic. 50 years old, and many still haven't learnt the core lesson: communication overhead is huge, and piling resources into projects often has the opposite impact to what you want.
2. [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) - I still reread this once a quarter, and still get insights from it.

### Product
1. [Don't Make Me Think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think) - advice on how to present users information clearly, and how to get 'real' feedback on existing interfaces.

### Architecture
1. [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.sg/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) - I love the author's definition of legacy code: "Code without unit tests". You could be writing legacy code today! Great advice for how to deal with black box applications without tests (or even documentation).

### People & Engineering Management
1. [Peopleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams) - many modern articles and books reveal insights that were described in Peopleware long ago. Save yourself time and go to the source.
2. [An Elegant Puzzle](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) - Will Larson is a modern engineering manager who writes beautifully, and always gives practical advice.
